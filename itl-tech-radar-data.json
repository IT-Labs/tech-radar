We've found that Dart as a programming language is very easy and intuitive to learn and use. The cross-platform development makes it easier to create application that can be used for both Android and iOS. It uses widgets, which makes it easier to create the user interface to with these building blocks, because all the objects are widget, so there is no need for Views like in Android. Flutter uses both Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation type during development, which speeds up app design, while it uses Ahead-of-Time (AOT) for the app release. For the main functionalities and packages that are developed by Google the documentation is great. However, since Flutter was released in 2017, it has gained a lot of popularity, but still has a lack of third-party libraries, a lot of the time even though a package exists it lacks support for newer Flutter releases. Also, a lot of these third-party packages lack proper documentation. Additionally, the Flutter app sizes are larger if you create the same application natively for Android and iOS.<br><br> <b>Useful links:</b> <br> <ul><li><a href=\"https://invotech.co/blog/flutter-pros-cons-should-you-use-it-in-your-project/\">Flutter pros and cons</a></li></ul><br><br> <b>People references:</b> <br> Mario Liptov"

      "description": "Testcontainers is a library, ported to multiple languages, that Dockerizes common test dependencies — including various types of databases, queuing technologies, cloud services and UI testing dependencies like web browsers — with the ability to run custom Dockerfiles when needed. <br>br> We've used Testcontainers on one of our project for integrations tests. Spring boot tests run has the option to start the application and load all dependencies as you run the application in your local environment. With test containers, you can spin a separate instance from your dependencies as database, Redis, mongo, rabbitMq, or your own docker file. The benefits are the ability to run integration tests with other services same as code is used in production ex: executing queries in dB, running search query in elastic search, more confidence  with upgrades to any library and fast feedback for any issue during the upgrades. However, in the case of many services and many containers, tests start is slow. We also had issues with  test container runner, sometimes require images clean /or test container library upgrade. We were not able to start the docker-compose file, at the time when we were implementing it. The library consumes a lot of computer resources during test and the containers test data is destroyed after tests finish. <br><br> <b>Useful links:</b> <br> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.testcontainers.org/\">Testcontainers site</a></li></ul><br><br> <b>People references:</b> <br> Jovica Krstevski"
